# VDOT Calculator
This repository is for calculating a runner's VDOT from one of their long distance running times, as well as calculating other associated values (such as training paces, and predicted times for other distances.

## Running Information

### VDOT
VDOT refers to the approximate VO2 Max of a runner (approximate is used here as values are based on performance instead of laboratory results). In other words, this is the maximum amount of oxygen the runner can utilise during intense exercise. The more oxygen a runner can use, the more energy that their body can produce. Therefore, we can expect a VDOT score to correlate with performance times.

For more information, see the [Wikipedia entry for VO2 max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max).

### Training Paces
Jack Daniels, whose initial research in the 1970s led to widespread use of VDOT among athletes, defined five levels of training intensity that can be calculated from a VDOT score:
 - Easy/Long (EL) Pace: the pace for recovery runs, long runs, warm-ups, and cool downs.
 - Marathon (M) Pace: the pace at which one would expect to complete a marathon.
 - Threshold (T) Pace: the pace aimed to raise the lactate threshold.
 - Interval (I) Pace: the pace aimed to raise the maximum oxygen uptake capacity.
 - Repetition (R) Pace: the pace for 200m-400m interval training.

The conversion from VDOT to paces is based upon your current VDOT, not a hopeful VDOT or a goal time for a future race. Therefore, it is important to use a recently run time when calculating your VDOT and paces, instead of using a time you want to achieve. This will allow you to get the most out of your training without increasing the risk of injury.
